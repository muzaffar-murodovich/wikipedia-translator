"""
link_labels.py - Wikilink label cleanup (translation_rules.md rule 2)

A wikilink target is resolved from Wikidata while its label comes from the
translation model, so the two regularly disagree on the spelling of the same
name: [[Lohur|Lahor]]. Rule 2 wants them to agree.

Only the pipe of a label that is the *same name* spelled differently may be
dropped. A label that is a different word carries the sentence grammar and
must stay: [[Somalilar|somalilik]] collapsed to [[Somalilar]] breaks the text.
Everything this module cannot judge mechanically is reported instead, so the
violation shows up in the run log rather than staying silent.
